Rafa: 
Cities distribution: when we will replace this graph with the data from the Africapolis-Worldpop overlay, we should clearly agree on how to do it and ensure consistency with what will be displayed in the city-level platform. My suggestion is that for the 2020 datapoint this should be based on Africapolis (extent)+ World pop data; For projections (2025 onwards), it would have to be based on Africapolis projections (or applying Africapolis projected growth to each 2020 point, probably not a big difference). Of course, this will also apply to the “Cities evolution” graph.

Exposure to flood hazard: I am not sure we should breakdown the data by coastal VS pluvial+ fluvial in those graphs. For exposure to coastal flood, absolute values are much lower than pluvial+fluvial and relative values are often flat or even on a downward trend at the end of the period (potentially conveying the wrong message for TTL that quickly look through the dashboard). I would display the combined exposure to the 3 flood hazards and add a footnote clarifying that the 3 are included. Also I would use the same “Display mode” feature that you had in the “historical disasters” tab to allow users to easily switch between absolute and relative exposure. To me the difference between absolute and relative exposure to flood is a more important message we can convey with those graphs than the difference between coastal and pluvial+fluvial. Joaquin: To discuss because this could include double counting. I will think about it.


Also, since the city-level platform will not allow us to use timeseries graph, I would include here  tabs to show the timeseries of exposure to flood at city-level (similar to those we had in the last version of the SO). We can keep the 5 larger cities for each country. This is an informative graph that is worth including as it shows that the evolution of exposure to flood is differentiated at the city-level and largely driven by local factors.
