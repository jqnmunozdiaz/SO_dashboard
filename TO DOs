Rafa: 
Cities distribution: when we will replace this graph with the data from the Africapolis-Worldpop overlay, we should clearly agree on how to do it and ensure consistency with what will be displayed in the city-level platform. My suggestion is that for the 2020 datapoint this should be based on Africapolis (extent)+ World pop data; For projections (2025 onwards), it would have to be based on Africapolis projections (or applying Africapolis projected growth to each 2020 point, probably not a big difference). Of course, this will also apply to the “Cities evolution” graph.
