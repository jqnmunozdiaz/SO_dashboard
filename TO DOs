Rafa: 
Cities distribution: when we will replace this graph with the data from the Africapolis-Worldpop overlay, we should clearly agree on how to do it and ensure consistency with what will be displayed in the city-level platform. My suggestion is that for the 2020 datapoint this should be based on Africapolis (extent)+ World pop data; For projections (2025 onwards), it would have to be based on Africapolis projections (or applying Africapolis projected growth to each 2020 point, probably not a big difference). Of course, this will also apply to the “Cities evolution” graph.

# gdp_3d_with_screenshots.py. The file is the best I can do to get a 3D visualization. The issue is that it cannot be saved automatically. I have to now redo the same for population and find a clever way to save the images using selenium. I could provide custom zoom and hgiht/weight instructions for different countries... To time consuming and I doubt it will produce nice results so I abandon for now.
