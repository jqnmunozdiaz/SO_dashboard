EN.POP.SLUM.UR.ZS,Population Living in Slums (% of Urban Population),"Population living in slums is the proportion of the urban population living in slum households. A slum household is defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, housing durability, and security of tenure, as adopted in the Millennium Development Goal Target 7.D. The successor, the Sustainable Development Goal 11.1.1, considers inadequate housing (housing affordability) to complement the above definition of slums/informal settlements."
EG.ELC.ACCS.UR.ZS,"Access to Electricity, Urban (% of Urban Population)","Access to electricity, urban is the percentage of urban population with access to electricity."
SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS,Urban Population (% of Total Population),"Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. The data are collected and smoothed by United Nations Population Division. Aggregation of urban and rural population may not add up to total population because of different country coverage. There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban from rural areas. Therefore, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution."
NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.KD,"GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2021 international $)","This indicator provides values for gross domestic product (GDP) expressed in constant international dollars, converted by purchasing power parities (PPPs). PPPs account for the different price levels across countries and thus PPP-based comparisons of economic output are more appropriate for comparing the output of economies and the average material well-being of their inhabitants than exchange-rate based comparisons.
